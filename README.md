# Optic_pathway_simulation

This is my final project for Math for Developers course in SoftUni (2025)

## Project focus:
In this project, we focus on the early stages of the RGCs journey â€” specifically, how RGC axons grow from their starting positions in the retina through the optic fiber layer (1) to the optic disc (2), the exit point from the eye. If we zoom at the back of the eye we can see where all the cells of interest are located (Fig 2). The axons need to grow "up" towards the inside of the eye, where they join the axons of other RGCs and form the optic fiber layer and then turn towards the center where the optic disc is located.

## The project goal is to use:

1. Vector fields and gradients to represent chemical cues guiding axons
2. Discrete time steps to simulate axon movement

In order to make the axons follow a trajectory similar to the one described above, namely:

1. Move up from their starting possitions
2. Move centrally towards the midline
3. Descend into the otic disc target zone
